<p>Country level initiatives to open data have given way to an important shift in local governments towards openness. Cities are becoming important players in the shift towards open data which is seen as a means to improve urban planning, service delivery and governance. This session will explore some examples of this as well as the implications that open data strategies have on generating more open local governments.</p>
